    <p>Bees are one of the insects most closely associated with human production and life on earth, and they are mainly responsible for pollination, which is a crucial part of the plant growth process. Through bee pollination, plants can reproduce better and produce products that are essential to human being, such as food. With the development of human society, bees face a variety of challenges, most of which come from changes in their living environment and interference from other factors. At this stage, pollution by pesticides, climate change, and the expansion of human activities have become key factors in the reduction of bee populations, not excluding some natural disasters and bee diseases that have led to population declines. If bees become extinct, humans may be headed for extinction.Therefore, we believe that bees are very important and therefore we will discuss here the pattern of bee population development over time.</p>

      <p>We finished writing the paper and collecting the data and managed to finish the paper before the due date!</p>

    <p>To discuss the pattern of changes in the number of bees over time and in other additional questions, we start by analyzing the first problem. We first performed an analysis that divides the bees into three main categories: larvae, internal bees, and external bees. We then determined the basic variables, where the positive variable is the production of eggs and the negative variable is the death of external bees, and we assume that the number of bees inside the hive will only increase and not decrease. Next, we analyzed the lifespan of bees in spring and summer (April to September) and the lifespan of bees in winter (October to March of the following year). In the end, we derive a relational equation for the number of bees. For the second question, we identify several key factors that affect the change in the total number of bees, which are: the coefficient of the self-feeding skill of young bees, the coefficient of the assisted feeding skills of adult bees, the natural mortality rate and the survival rate. We divided them into two main categories and then performed the entropy weighting method. Due to the results that shows there is the most significant change in the total number of bees when changing the natural survival rate (ratio between death and survive), we come the conclusion that the natural survival rate of bees is the most critical and weighted factor that affects the total number of bees.</p>
    <p>To analyze the last question, The problem we are solving is to study a simulation and predict how many honey bee hives you would need to support the pollination of a 20-acre (81,000 m2) plot of land, and based on the data we have obtained, we calculate the mean of the variables involved by taking the following formula. </p>
